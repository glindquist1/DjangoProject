#My comments:
#Each model is represented by a class that subclasses django.db.models.Model. 
#Each model has a number of class variables, each of which represents a database field in the model.

#Each field is represented by an instance of a Field class – e.g., CharField for character fields and DateTimeField for datetimes. 
#This tells Django what type of data each field holds.
